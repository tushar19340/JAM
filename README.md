# JAM
Just About Music (JAM) is platform that allows people to come together at one place and remotely take part in music collaboration.

Our vision to help bring musicians and artists together who are new to
this field and are just starting out; to explore and produce music on a
platform where they can freely collaborate without the constraints of
any physical or skill barrier.

The intent behind this project is to provide a platform where people can
collaborate freely even when physical barriers make it hard to do so. We
want to help musicians brainstorm freely in an environment and record
their music without having to put extra efforts in the post production
process.
